The model is currently valuing y coordinate data much more than other features, which is wrong given that invalid elements in second phase of filtration can be present at any height. (references, images)

Inference - The data is causing a huge amount of bias in the algorithm, in terms of population data. It may be removed by eliminating children of elements which get labelled 0 in the dataset.


1. 'hatnote' and 'noprint' and 'quote' and 'empty' and 'editsection' can be introduced as  red flag classes.

2. Include style attribute too as a feature. Some elements have style = 'display:none'

3. Contains the text 'Reference' or 'See Also' or 'Further reading' or 'External links' in h2. May be this can be convoluted with tag_header feature like - tag_header * is_not_Reference.

4. Include 'pre' in formatting tags too.

5. Add one more feature - 'span' tag with 'math' in class.

6. You should use some multiplier * word_count instead of just word_count. This multiplier must be high for headers, as they innately contain less words. However, for a tags, b tags , i tags inside p tags, the word_count is also low. How do you assign some sort of multiplier to them? Instead of multiplying, may be use a log transform, or try both?

6. Include a tag_style may be.
