It was developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. Spring framework makes the easy development of JavaEE application.

Spring is a lightweight framework. It can be thought of as a framework of frameworks because it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, etc.

The Spring framework comprises several modules such as IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, ORM, WEB MVC etc. We will learn these modules in next page. Let's understand the IOC and Dependency Injection first.

These are the design patterns that are used to remove dependency from the programming code. They make the code easier to test and maintain.

In such case, there is dependency between the Employee and Address (tight coupling). In the Inversion of Control scenario, we do this something like this:

Thus, IOC makes the code loosely coupled. In such case, there is no need to modify the code if our logic is moved to new environment.

In Spring framework, IOC container is responsible to inject the dependency. We provide metadata to the IOC container either by XML file or annotation.

There are many advantages of Spring Framework. They are as follows:

Spring framework provides templates for JDBC, Hibernate, JPA etc. technologies. So there is no need to write too much code. It hides the basic steps of these technologies.

Let's take the example of JdbcTemplate, you don't need to write the code for exception handling, creating connection, creating statement, committing transaction, closing connection etc. You need to write the code of executing query only. Thus, it save a lot of JDBC code.

The Dependency Injection makes easier to test the application. The EJB or Struts application require server to run the application but Spring framework doesn't require server.

Spring framework is lightweight because of its POJO implementation. The Spring Framework doesn't force the programmer to inherit any class or implement any interface. That is why it is said non-invasive.
